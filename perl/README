From Susan Miller:

Reference1 is the 35kb sequence that has Haplotype I && II versions, and for that one samples 1070 & 1072 were mapped to the HapI version and samples 1036 & 1042 were mapped to the Hap II version.

Reference 2 is the 87kb sequence and all 4 samples were mapped to it.


From Bismark manual:

The methylation extractor output looks like this (tab separated):
(1) seq-ID
(2) methylation state
(3) chromosome
(4) start position (= end position)
(5) methylation call

Methylation call:

The methylation call string contains a dot ‘.’ for every position in the BS-read not involving a
cytosine, or contains  one of  the following letters for the three different  cytosine  methylation 
contexts (UPPER CASE = METHYLATED, lower case = unmethylated):

z unmethylated C in CpG context
Z methylated C in CpG context 
x unmethylated C in CHG context
X methylated C in CHG context
h unmethylated C in CHH context
H methylated C in CHH context
